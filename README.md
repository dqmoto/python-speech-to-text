# python-speech-to-text
Simple experiment space for basic speech to text 

Just pulled this example from a few online resources

I want to try pyttsx3 2.87 next. to go the other way. Text -> Speech



Just run speech.py

Allow for microphone on your machine.
Follow prompt -> "Say Somthing".

translate the speech to morse code
translate to a visual to represent basic American sign-language
translate to a visual format, LEDS, or somthing like that
